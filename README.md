# Radiomics_features

- The aim of the homework is to prepare a technical report which should provide a justified opinion on the use of radiomics analysis for DAT SPECT imaging as biomarker of PD 

- RESEARCH QUESTIONS:

By using the data collected from a PD study, this report should address the following questions:

PART 1 â€“ GROUP DIFFERENCES

o Is there any difference between controls and PD in radiomics features (or combined score)?
o Are the radiomic features or any derived scores associated to PD clinical symptoms severity?

PART 2 - INDIVIDUAL PREDICTION

o Are the radiomics features capable to distinguish patients from controls?
